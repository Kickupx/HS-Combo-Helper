# Educational use only
# HS-Combo-Helper
View statistics about in how many turn you will be able to make your combos.
This is done by inspecting the memory of Hearthstone and actually reading text from the window 
but it is NEVER inserting/injecting/hooking anything.
Therefore dodging most of the problems with warden.

## Features
- Add your own combos, per deck
- View statistics as an overlay. This overlay is in fact just an topmost window.
- Filters out combos which can not be played due to dead cards.

## TODO
- Allow other window sizes than 800x600 pixels.
- Make card information more robust.

## Use it

This software uses BotKitty as it's runtime. It can be downloaded [here](http://botkitty.com/download.html).
Then download the latest [release](https://github.com/Kickupx/HS-Combo-Helper/releases) of HS Combo Helper and add it to botkitty.

Make sure Hearthstone is not running in fullscreen mode and that you are not inside a match.
You are now ready to start BotKitty.
Your hearthstone window will change size. If you want to get rid of that pull requests are welcome. :)
When you actually enter a game the overlay will pop up and you are ready to go.

## Contributing
If you care enough to fix some of the TODO's or if you want to fix something else pull requests are welcome. :)
If you do not know where to get started contact me and we can figure it out. :)

If you want to contribute you probably care about how this bot is made.
I will be writing an article about the whole process I went through to get this bot running.
